Percentile
--

Half of the values in a column are greater than the 50th percentile and half are less than the 50th percentile.

Descrete percentile is a value in the ordered list

Continuous percentile interpolates values of the boundary between percentiles, if needed.
Continuous percentiles are useful when you want to know what is the value at the boundary between two percentile buckets.
What description specifically applies to continuous percentiles? they interpolate the boundary value between percentiles

--
correlation, row_number, and mode
--

They help you understand how data within a row and across a row relate to each other.

Correlation is a measure of how the values of two variables change with respect to each other.
ROW_NUMBER assigns a value to a position of a row in a sorted list of values.
MODE - What is the function that returns the most frequently occurring value in a group of rows?

---
linear regression
---

The linear regression functions are designed to fit regression lines while minimizing error.
In order to make prediction using the regression line, you need the slope and the y-intercept.

if A is below:          then, xA is below:
  a b c                   xa xb xc

A + B = 0
=> B = -A

if A is below:          => B is below:
  a b c                   -a -b -c
  d e f                   -d -e -f
