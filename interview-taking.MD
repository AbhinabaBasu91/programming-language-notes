Max interviews/day = 13
Every interview = 30 mins

If interview result is fail
  provide more feedback
    risky?
    some have offers (TA wont tell interviewer) so they can rude
    some act childish for senior positions, so there will doubt if they can perform at a senior roles
  dont provide more feedback
    good/ bad?


Candidate expects too much salary for his experience
  ask him/her to verify expectations on glassdoor

Spend enough time for F2F interviews
  coz of the time spent towards you
  if you sense the interview result is a fail, end soon, and spend 5 to 10 mins talking on where you felt what
  yes, risky, but most will appreciate
  mostly show them a way to improve.
