SOW
Scope of Work

	A Scope of Work (SOW) provides
		detailed information on a project,
		often from the client side, and
			may include things like
				project size,
				budget,
				schedule,
				background,
				involved parties/authorities having jurisdiction,
				review processes,
				and any other information the client deems pertinent to provide.

	Providing a SOW allows
		a client to receive
			more detailed and
			tailored proposals
				for the projects
				they’re requesting

Proposal

	A proposal is a marketing tool
		that responds
			to the requirements
				given in the SOW.

	A proposal may include
		a section on understanding the project,
		in which
			the proposer reiterates their interpretation of the SOW and
			explains how they might accomplish it

---------------------------------
SOW is a statement of work
	which can be part of
		a Request for Proposal (RFP) or
		even part of the proposal.

Proposal has much more then just
	a statement of work or
	even the technical approach.

	A proposal consists of several sections, including but not limited to:
		technical volume
		management volume
		cost volume
		representations and warranties
		exceptions
		resumes
		and past experience.

		A proposal also tends to have
			one or more win-themes and
			one or more themes
			which differentiate the offerer (the team, company, or individual submitting the proposal)
				from its competition.
		The proposal sells the potential customer on the idea that
			the offerer is the best choice and
			that the price is the best price
				(not always the lowest although that is the horrible trend in US Government contracting).
		The proposal is the
			ultimate sales and
			marketing and
			(light) engineering and
			(light) description of the best organization and people to do the work



Proposal is an
	non-binding
	not-legal document
		which just consists of the
			bidder’s proposal
			in terms of
				solution
				indicative pricing
				experience and
				expertise, etc.
