SOW
Scope of Work

		A Scope of Work (SOW) provides
			detailed information on a project,
			often from the client side, and
				may include things like
					project size,
					budget,
					schedule,
					background,
					involved parties/authorities having jurisdiction,
					review processes,
					and any other information the client deems pertinent to provide.

			Providing a SOW allows
				a client to receive
					more detailed and
					tailored proposals
						for the projects
						theyâ€™re requesting

Proposal

		A proposal is a marketing tool
			that responds
				to the requirements
					given in the SOW.
