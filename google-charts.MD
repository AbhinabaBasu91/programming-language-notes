its possible to use css to change the elements display style

or even use the javascript to find elements change the style/ display properties, or the elements themselves under the svg

we can create svg elements too.
however slight change in DOM functions
createElement becomes createElementNS when creating an svg element

it's easy if we can find the options for it
or, we can do css & javascript

this is definitely not simple 3 hours of work for complex charts, however its possible to do anywhere from 3 to 7 days of time if you are new to google charts
